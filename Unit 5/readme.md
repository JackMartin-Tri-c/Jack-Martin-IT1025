# Introduction to networking
### Data transmition: 
### Packet: Unit Of data 
### Packet Switching: Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on the destination address 
### IP Address: Unique identifing numbers
### DNS: directory of ip Adresses common names for example 54.293.26.214 might be amazon
### Protocall: Set of rules that allows devices to communicate. 
### All of the terms above work iin unison to help us use the intertnet and makes up the internet as we know it today. 
### Network Hardware: A switch is better than a hub because A hub will share data accross multiple pcs that are connected to it regardless of weather the data needs to go there or not. Where as a switch will send data t o only the device that needs it. On both of the devices data can only be sent over a local network. With a router you can send data over the widerweb and to other computers that are not connected to the local network. 
### Network Topologies: Single points of failure are when a network can be shut down by one item in the topology goes down. This can happen in configureations like the star configuration. This can also be seen in the ring configuration where data is being sent arpund a ring to get to the neccicary computer. In my opinion wirless mesh is a better system than a network topology. it cuts donw on the amount of work you have to do upfront by runng wire and keeping computers in place with a wireless system a laptop can be tkaen to any room in the building and still get internet accesss. 
### My network has bee4n madewith a wireless router connecting to several pc's to my it makes the most sense because of the lack of wiring needed at each desk.
