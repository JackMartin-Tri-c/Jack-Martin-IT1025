# Introduction to networking
### Data transmition: 
### Packet: Unit Of data 
### Packet Switching: Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on the destination address 
### IP Address: Unique identifing numbers
### DNS: directory of ip Adresses common names for example 54.293.26.214 might be amazon
### Protocall: Set of rules that allows devices to communicate. 
### All of the terms above work iin unison to help us use the intertnet and makes up the internet as we know it today. 
### Network Hardware: A switch is better than a hub because A hub will share data accross multiple pcs that are connected to it regardless of weather the data needs to go there or not. Where as a switch will send data t o only the device that needs it. On both of the devices data can only be sent over a local network. With a router you can send data over the widerweb and to other computers that are not connected to the local network. 
### Network Topologies: Single points of failure are when a network can be shut down by one item in the topology goes down. This can happen in configureations like the star configuration. This can also be seen in the ring configuration where data is being sent arpund a ring to get to the neccicary computer. In my opinion wirless mesh is a better system than a network topology. it cuts donw on the amount of work you have to do upfront by runng wire and keeping computers in place with a wireless system a laptop can be tkaen to any room in the building and still get internet accesss. 
### My network has bee4n madewith a wireless router connecting to several pc's to my it makes the most sense because of the lack of wiring needed at each desk. 
# nsa/css: The NSA is very important to our nations security not only do they look for threats to our nathon on the internet. They do this by looking for extreamist activity and protecting current national secrets. 
# Cyber Security and Encryption
### Information systems security: If I were apart of a amazon chat the security triad would effect my job in many ways. The first being i could not share any of the information on the persons profile with anyone. This includes address and email. Second I could not deny access to a customers account if they own the account. Thirdly I would have to verify that the information given to them was correct. One tast that requires authentication in my daily life is entering my home. I can do this by entering a code to get through the door and this could be made multi factor by also requiring a key to unlick a second deadbolt. One of the other daily tasks is going to work. When i am there I am known by my boss and he authorises me to be there. This could be taken to multi factor by having me clock in. my final daily task that requires authentication is checking my school email. This can be taken to two factor by having a code sent to me via text to enter to make sure it is me logging in. ACL Is a access controll list this allows a list of users to have specific access. Then there is RBCA This is roll based controll access each roll is given specific access then users are assigned a roll. ACL is nice because you can fine tune access if a user needs some permmisions that may not fit thier roll in a RBAC system. This will help productivity. This how ever may cause issues if some people with the same job dont have access that others do. RBAC is nice becuase you only need to set up permissions once and assign users a roll this will save time. However you have less fine tune controll over access. Cypher text is used to enycrip a message that would normaly be stored as plain text. Then to be able to read the data you need to dycript this information. When the sender send over the information it is encryped with cypertext and a public key. Then when the recipient gets this information it is sent over to recipient with a private key that dycrypts the data conveting the cypher text back to plain text. Public Key encyption is important becuase it will help prevent anyone who is attempting to steal the information being sent from gaining access to the information becuase of the private key they are both using. 
### Cryptography: The Cesar Cypher is a method of encyptic data done by shifting the letter you mean to write three places over. When I type Cryptography is a growing field and enycript it using the cesar cypher i end up getting etarvqitcrja ku c itqykpi hkgnf. When typing my message in the the frequency finder i did find that i pretty much fell in line with the frequency finder. I do think this would be different in another language. with the changing of the word structure based on our langues rules.
