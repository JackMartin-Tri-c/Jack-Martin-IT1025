# Jack-Martin-IT1025
# Executive Summary 
### The goal of this lab is to get a introduction to IT1025. IT1025 will introduce us to Git Hub as well as information systems concepts and history. With this class we will hope to better learn why IT is important in buissness and to show that even if you are not passonate about it will be used in your professional world and will be extramly usefull. 
# Information Systems Components 
### Information systems is made up of 5 major components 
##### Hardware is the first component of information systems this is what allows us to collect process store and distribute information. This can be done by pieces of hardware such as cpu's that process information or stroage devices such as solid state drives. 
##### Software. This is how we present information and make it accessable to people as well as interact with hardware. One major example of software is your operatin system. Our operating systems makes use of our hardware to display information. 
##### Data. This information that we can use to not only achive a desired outcome but also predict future trends. 
##### People. People are one of the most important components in information systems. People make use of hardware software and data to improve the lifes of themselves and others around them. 
##### Process. The process is how we orgonise and use information systems to make our professional world and personal world more effecent. With process we can make best use of the above components. 
### Client Server Architecture 
##### Client server Architecture is a way to connect computers and share information. Git Hub is the perfect example of this. by loggging onto github I can access information from the server where a project is saved and add it to my own computer from there I can work on the project and improve the system. The original data is still stored on Git Hubs server but now is also on my computer locally. 
### Cloud Computing
##### Could computing is being able to access hardware with out direct management from the user. This is mostly used as remote storage over the internet but this can also beused for things such as streaming video or playing games. One examole of this this stadia. This is a servie provided by google that alows you to stream a videogame right to a desktop tv or other compatable device.
### In conclusion I have learned about the components of information systems and some of the basic funtions of Git Hub. I found Git Hub to be a bit daunting at first but after spending some time in the program the features it provides are wonderfull.I hope to expand my knowledge of all of the components of information systems to help me become a more well rounded IT professional as well as to help me discover what area I would like to foucus in.
