# Executive summary 

### The goal of this lesson is to educate our selves and other on the hardware componenets of the computer as well as break down how the componets process data. We plan to achive this goal by showing all of the componets one at a time and explaining what they do for the system. then we will show how the computer sees information so we better understand how computers work

# Hardware

### Hard Drives and memory: Hard drives store information for long periods of time and can be thoght of as long term memory. They operate by writing information on a magnetic disk with a mechnical arm. Memory or random access memory (Ram) can be thought of a short term memory. Its like remembering a number before you have a chance to write it donw. Solid state drives are the latest form of storage repalcing traditional hard drives. with solid state drives there are no moving parts so there is almost no speed limit on them making them much faster than the traaditional hard drive. A added benifit of no moving parts is increased reliability. a drop will not slowdonw or ruin the harddrive but a solid state drive can withstand a stronger beating than a harddrive. when it comes to random access memory it is important to have a lot in your system because it is the bridge between the hard drive and the cpu. if you dont have enough memory then you will have to send data from the slower hard drive to the cpu. ram has come in two different forms one being a 64 bit data path and the ohter being a 32 bit data path. the difference being the amount of data transfered per clock cycle. with 64 bit every time a cycle happens 64 bits of data are transfered with 32 bit every time a cycle happenes its only 

### ALU and Controll Unit: The ALU is the arithmatic logic unit. This Will handel any and all calculations that are given to it by the contorll unit. The controll unit gets instructions from ram and then hands the instructions off the the alu. The alu will then put out a output. 
### Hardware CPU Input Output: In this example you are inputing information from the self check out unit into the computer via scanning the bar code. The CPU will the process the information and output a price and what item it is. All three are used in this example as well as hardware playing a roll.
### Logic Gates: truth tables are a way of explaining how the physical action of a signal looks and what different gates do. this applies perfectly because computing is just ones and zeros and logic gates are how the computer can decipher and produce ones and zeros.
### IEEE - Ethicallly alligned design: Ethics is important when designing and program or ai or even hardware because of the negative impact it could have on our sociity. 
# Data Representaion 
### Numerical conversion: Decimal hexadecimal and bianary all operate off a different set of base powers and number of digets. Decimal is a power of ten and has ten digits ranging from zero to nine. Hexadecimal operates on base power of 16 and has 16 digits ranging from zero to nine as well as the letter A through F. Lastly we have bianary that operates on bases of two and only has two digits zero or one.
