# File Compression
### Zip Files are used to get multiple files to act like one. This is done to make it easier for files to be shared. The best example of this is when you want to send a lot of data over an email. The file size might be to large for the email so if you add all the files to a zip file they can be compressed in to one smaller file. When I compressed the SVG file it went from 288 kb to 128 kb. If I am being honest I am not sure what would happen if I did this with a jpeg file, so I did it. I am surprised when I compressed it into a zip file I saw no loss in file size. I think this is becuase the file was already compressed with lossy compression. So to confirm that theory I did it with a 4k PNG file that uses loss less compression. When I compressed the png file the file size went from about 750 kb to 500 kb.  
# Python OOP
### Shark is using two methids in this case. First it is using the swim() method and then it is using the be_awesome() methid. The attributes are print("The shark is swimming.") and print("The shark is awesome."). The constructor method is used to initilise data in the program that you would like initilised with the object. The constructor method is automaticly initialized. A Class is a blueprint created by a programmer for and object it contains a set of attributes that will characterize any object that is instantiated from the class. A object is the realised version of a class in a program. To instantiate a object from a class is to represent that object in a instance. 
# Object Oriented Concepts 
### The object that are instantiated in the shark program are sammie and stevie. Inheratance is almost like having a subclass. So the best way I can think of it is relating it to video games. You may start out as a rouge but thats vauge. So then you add a subclass like thief, assasin, and saboutre. You still have all the things that make you a rouge but you gain new attributes that make you one of the three. If we were to do this in the shark example We could add a parent class called aquatic. This could have the Swim attribute in it then we could make another child class called fish and add the forgetful attribute to it. Both shark and Fish would be children of the Aquatic class and have the swim atribute.
