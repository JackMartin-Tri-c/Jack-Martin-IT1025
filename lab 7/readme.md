# File Compression
### Zip Files are used to get multiple files to act like one. This is done to make it easier for files to be shared. The best example of this is when you want to send a lot of data over an email. The file size might be to large for the email so if you add all the files to a zip file they can be compressed in to one smaller file. When I compressed the SVG file it went from 288 kb to 128 kb. If I am being honest I am not sure what would happen if I did this with a jpeg file, so I did it. I am surprised when I compressed it into a zip file I saw no loss in file size. I think this is becuase the file was already compressed with lossy compression. So to confirm that theory I did it with a 4k PNG file that uses loss less compression. When I compressed the png file the file size went from about 750 kb to 500 kb.
