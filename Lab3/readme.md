# Executive Summary 
### 
# Software 
### Operating systems: Operating systems can be thougth of as the foundations for all applications on the computer. This allows other programs and software to interact with the hardware. One of the most perdominatne operating systems is Microsoft Windows. this is one of the largest and most programs are made with this operating system in mind when being developed. 
### Utility software: Utility software is a program that allows you to fix or modifiy your computer in someway. One example of this is anti malware software such as malware bytes. This fills in the gaps left by your operating system by adding extra protection.  
### Applications: Uitility software are applications that can be used to aid or automate a process. One such software is Microsoft Office. This software allows you to make all sorts of documents spreadsheets and pwerpoints.
### Enterprise software: Enterprise software is a custome built software to keep all of a companys processes in one place. It has all the information processes forms and data all in one place. Microsoft has enterprise solutions for compnays such as specific versions of windows that need to be loged into a vpn inorder for them to work. 
# Virtulisation
### Virtulisation allows single use server to become multi use ones. This allows the equipment you are buying to be used more efficently and makes it so you need to buy less. This lowers the cost of entry when making a new server. 
### Hypervisor: this is what allows the virtual space to use physical hardware. I think of this as a enginge controll unit on a car. the hypervisor recieves a request then allocates the appropiate amount of hardware like how a engine controll unit tells the fule injectors the right amount of gas to out put to recieve the perfict air fule mixture. 
### Cloud Computing Vs. Virtulization: The big difference betwen cloud computing and virtulization to me is the atuomation. they can both make one set of hardware many but the important part is cloud computing distibutes recorces automaticly where as virtulisation requires user imput each time. 
### Moving to cloud based infrastructre can be done by adding a management software that automaticly allocates resources and making a self serve portal for useres to get on demand access to the cloud. 
# Python
### Psudo Code: this is a coding languae that is inteded for human reading rather than computer reading. 
### Compiled languae takes the code written and transforms it into bianary where as interprited langue dose not get converted into bianary. 
# Career exploration
### Career Expansion: I have found that most of of the job postings are for help desk technicians. This is quite good for me as I think I would make a good customer support tech.
